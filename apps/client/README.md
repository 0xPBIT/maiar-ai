# Maiar Client

A React-based monitoring dashboard for Maiar AI agents. This client connects to a running Maiar agent via WebSocket and provides real-time visualization of agent state, context chains, events, and more.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of your Maiar agent
- Visualize current pipeline execution
- Track context chains and state transitions
- Monitor events as they occur
- Chat interface for direct interaction with your agent
- Responsive, grid-based layout
- Dynamic WebSocket URL configuration from the UI

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.13.1 or higher
- pnpm (recommended) or npm/yarn

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maiar-ai/maiar.git
cd maiar
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Navigate to the client directory:

```bash
cd maiar-client
```

### Development

To start the client in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the client on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

### Connecting to a Maiar Agent

By default, the client connects to WebSocket at `ws://localhost:3000/monitor`.

To enable the WebSocket monitor in your Maiar agent, add the provider to your agent configuration:

```typescript
// imports above ...

const agent = await Runtime.init({
  // ... other configurations
  options: {
    logger: {
      level: "debug",
      transports: [websocket({ path: "/monitor" }) /* other transports */]
    }
  }
});
```

### Chat API Configuration

The chat panel connects to a default endpoint of `http://localhost:3000/chat`. This endpoint can be configured in the same way as the WebSocket connection.

To enable chat functionality in your MAIAR agent, you need to add the [text plugin](https://github.com/uraniumcorporation/maiar-ai/tree/main/packages/plugin-text) to your agent configuration:

```typescript
const plugins: Plugin[] = [
  new TextGenerationPlugin()
  // ... other plugins
];

const agent = await Runtime.init({
  // ... other configurations
  plugins,
  options: {
    server: {
      port: 3000 // the port for your server
    }
  }
});
```

For a complete implementation example, refer to the [maiar-starter](https://github.com/maiar-ai/maiar/tree/main/maiar-starter) repository, which shows how to properly set up the Express plugin with the required message endpoint.

#### Changing the Chat API URL from the UI

You can change the Chat API URL directly from the client interface:

1. Click on the settings (gear) icon in the chat panel
2. Enter your custom Chat API URL in the provided field
3. Click "Apply" to use the new endpoint
4. Use "Reset URL" to revert to the default Chat API URL (`http://localhost:3002/message`)

This allows you to:

- Connect to different chat backends
- Test with different agent configurations
- Switch between development and production environments

Both the WebSocket and Chat API default endpoints are centrally configured in the application.

### Dashboard Components

The dashboard includes the following components:

- **Current Pipeline**: Visualizes the current execution pipeline and its status
- **Context Chain**: Displays the current context chain being processed
- **Events**: Shows a log of events from the agent
- **Chat**: Provides a simple interface to interact with the agent (if chat functionality is enabled)

### Customizing the Layout

The dashboard uses React Grid Layout for a flexible, responsive layout. You can customize the layout by modifying the grid configuration in `src/components/GridLayout.tsx` or by dragging and dropping the panels to different positions in the client interface.
