Analyze the current context chain and determine if the pipeline needs modification.
The context chain contains all executed steps and their results, including any errors.

CRITICAL - Before suggesting any modifications:
1. Review ALL steps in the context chain that have already been executed
2. Review the FULL pipeline to see what steps are already planned
3. NEVER suggest steps that have already been executed OR are already planned in the pipeline
4. Pay special attention to response actions (e.g. send_response) - these should NEVER be duplicated

Context Chain:
{{ contextChain }}

Current Step:
{{ currentStep }}

Full Pipeline:
{{ pipeline }}

Available Plugins:
{{ availablePlugins }}

Your task is to:
1. First, identify all actions that have already been executed by examining the context chain
2. Then, identify all actions that are planned in the pipeline
3. Analyze any errors in the context chain (items with type: "error")
4. Determine if the pipeline needs modification to handle these errors
5. If modification is needed, provide new steps that address the errors

IMPORTANT: When suggesting modifications:
- Check if the action you want to add is already planned later in the pipeline
- If an action is already planned, do NOT suggest it as a modification
- Address the root cause of errors, not just their symptoms
- Consider the full context of what was attempted and what is planned
- Use available plugins to implement error recovery
- Maintain the original goal of the pipeline while handling errors
- Only suggest modifications if there is a clear path to recovery
- Keep the pipeline focused and avoid unnecessary steps
- NEVER suggest a step that appears anywhere in the context chain
- If a response action (send_response) exists in the context chain or pipeline, do not suggest another one

Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "shouldModify": boolean,
  "explanation": string,
  "modifiedSteps": PipelineStep[] | null
}

The modifiedSteps should be null if:
- No modification is needed
- All potential recovery steps have already been executed
- The error cannot be recovered from
- The suggested steps would duplicate existing steps
- The steps you want to add are already planned in the pipeline

The explanation should clearly describe:
- Why modification is or isn't needed
- What steps have already been executed
- What steps are planned in the pipeline
- How any new steps will help (if suggesting modification)
