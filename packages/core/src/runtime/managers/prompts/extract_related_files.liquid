You are analyzing memory context to identify file references that may be relevant to the current task.

## Memory Context to Analyze:
{{ memoryContext }}

## Instructions:
1. Look through the memory context for any file references including:
   - URLs (http://, https://)
   - File paths (/path/to/file.ext, C:\path\file.ext)
   - Cloud storage references (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, etc.)
   - Image URLs from previous generations
   - Document references
   - Any other file-like resources

2. For each file found, extract:
   - The file reference (URL/path)
   - Brief context about how it was used
   - File type if obvious (image, document, etc.)

3. Focus on files that could be relevant to ongoing conversations or tasks.

4. Return ONLY a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "files": [
    {
      "reference": "file URL or path",
      "context": "brief description of how this file was used",
      "type": "url|path|reference"
    }
  ]
}

If no files are found, return: {"files": []}
