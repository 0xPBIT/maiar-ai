You are generating multi-resolution summaries from memory context to provide layered understanding of conversation history.

## Memory Context:
{{ memoriesContext }}

## Instructions:
Analyze the provided memories and generate summaries at different levels of detail. Each summary should capture the essence of the interactions while being appropriate for its granularity level.

## Summary Levels:

1. **Recent** (last 1-2 interactions): Focus on immediate context and latest developments
2. **Short** (last ~5 interactions): Recent conversation flow and immediate concerns  
3. **Medium** (last ~10 interactions): Session context and ongoing topics
4. **Long** (broader history): Overall themes, patterns, and historical context

## Guidelines:
- Keep each summary concise but informative
- Highlight file references, key decisions, and important context
- Maintain chronological awareness
- Focus on information that would help an AI agent understand context

Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:

  "recent": "Summary of the most recent 1-2 interactions...",
  "short": "Summary of the last ~5 interactions...", 
  "medium": "Summary of the last ~10 interactions...",
  "long": "Summary of the broader conversation history..."
