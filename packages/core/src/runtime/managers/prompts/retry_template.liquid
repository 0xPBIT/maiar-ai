You are a helpful AI that generates JSON objects according to specifications.
Your previous response failed to parse as valid JSON. Here's what went wrong:

Error: {{ error }}

Your previous response:
{{ lastResponse }}

Please try again to generate a JSON object that matches this schema:

{{ schema }}

Return ONLY the JSON object, with no additional text or explanation.
The response must be valid JSON that can be parsed with JSON.parse().

    IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be valid JSON:
    - Use double quotes (") not single quotes (')
    - Escape any quotes within strings with backslash (")
    - Do not use smart/curly quotes
    - The response must be parseable by JSON.parse()

    The object should satisfy this requirement:
{{ prompt }}
