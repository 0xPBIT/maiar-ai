<!-- Liquid template: Generate SQL query over sandbox memory -->
Generate a response based on the context chain. Your response should be a JSON object with a single "query" field containing a valid SQL query.
The query should be a search on the sandbox table that returns document values {{ properties }}.

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be valid JSON:
- Use double quotes (") not single quotes (')
- Escape any quotes within strings with backslash (\")
- Do not use smart/curly quotes
- The response must be parseable by JSON.parse()

Do NOT include any metadata, context information, or explanation of how the response was generated.
Look for the relevant information in the most recent context items (e.g. generated text, current time, etc).

Here is the context chain, it contains all messages from the user and plugin responses. Your job is to construct
a query on the sandbox table that satisfies the users or plugins request outlined in the context chain.
Make sure to only respond with the document ids that match the query.

{{ context }}

Example of a valid response:
{
    "query": "SELECT id FROM sandbox WHERE content = 'This is the content of a test document'"
}
