Generate a response based on the context chain. Your response should be a JSON object with a single "query" field containing a valid SQL query on the sandbox table.

You must SELECT the following columns: {{ properties | join: ", " }}

Use proper SQL syntax: SELECT column1, column2 FROM sandbox WHERE conditions

CRITICAL: In SQL, escape single quotes by doubling them ('') not with backslashes (\')
Example: "what's up" becomes '%what''s up%' in LIKE clauses

IMPORTANT: Output MUST be valid JSON; no extra text.

Context chain:
{{ context }}

Example:
{
  "query": "SELECT id, content FROM sandbox WHERE content LIKE '%birthday%'"
}
