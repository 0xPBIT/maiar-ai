Your response should be a JSON object with a single "message" field containing your response text.

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be valid JSON:
- Use double quotes (") not single quotes (')
- Escape any quotes within strings with backslash (\")
- Do not use smart/curly quotes
- The response must be parseable by JSON.parse()
- Keep in mind Discord's message length limit of 2000 characters

Here is the Context Chain of the user's initial message and your internal operations:

Example of valid response:

Consider explicit markers:
- Direct mentions of the bot
- Command prefixes (messages starting with "${commandPrefix || "!"}")
- If it's a reply to the bot's message

AND consider contextual clues:
- Thematic continuity (is the message continuing a theme/topic from recent messages?)
- Semantic relationships (does the message reference concepts/ideas from recent conversation?)
- Conversational flow (does this naturally follow from the previous exchanges?)
- Implicit references (does the message refer to information only the bot previously provided?)
- Temporal proximity (how recent was the last interaction?)

Is mentioned: ${isMention}
Is reply: ${isReply}
Bot ID: ${botId}
Command prefix: "${commandPrefix || "!"}"

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be valid JSON:
- Use double quotes (") not single quotes (')
- The response must be parseable by JSON.parse()

Return a JSON object with:
- "isIntendedForAgent": boolean indicating if the message is meant for the agent
- "reason": string explaining why this determination was made
