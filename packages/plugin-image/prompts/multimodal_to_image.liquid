Prepare a text prompt AND list of reference images for a multimodal image engine.

From context chain extract any image URLs/paths; preserve order. If implied images are missing, invent placeholders.

Compose the prompt following the same guidelines as text_to_image.

Context chain:
{{ context }}

Return ONLY:
{
  "prompt": string,
  "images": string[]
}
