  Create an image based on a text prompt.

  You can use this tool when you need to create an image using soley text as the mechanism to generate the image.

  Calling this tools means a prompt will be constructed and passed to an AI which will generate an image based on the prompt.

  You can use this tool when you need to create an image using a text prompt and other images as reference.

  Calling this tools means a prompt will be constructed and passed to an AI which will generate an image based on the prompt and other reference images.
  Using this tool you can reimagine, recreate, recombine images and components of those images to create new images.

// Shared Prompting Guidelines
//************************************************** */

export const COMMON_PROMPT_GUIDELINES = `
    Guidelines for composing the prompt:
    • Analyse the provided Context Chain (chronological, newest last) and infer the user's latest intent and any creative constraints.
    • Follow this order so downstream tools can parse components easily:
      1. Main Subject        who / what should appear
      2. Descriptors         quantity, colours, emotions, motion, era, size, etc.
      3. Environment         setting / background / lighting / time-of-day
      4. Style Tags          medium, genre, artist references, rendering engine
      5. Technical Cues      camera lens, aspect ratio, resolution, colour palette
    • Focus on the most recent, relevant items in the chain; newer overrides older.
    • If the chain contains any "avoid" instructions or policy warnings, turn them into a short negative clause prefixed with "--no" (e.g. "--no text watermark").
    • Be vivid yet concise; 20-60 tokens is ideal.
    • Do NOT include any explanation or additional keys—only the prompt text itself.`;

export function textToImageTemplate(context: string): string {
  return `
    You are preparing a single PROMPT STRING that will be forwarded to an image-generation engine.

    ${COMMON_PROMPT_GUIDELINES}

    Context Chain:
    ${context}

    Return a JSON object with a single "prompt" field containing the composed prompt.
    Example:
    {
        "prompt": "A serene 3D render of a glass lighthouse on a cliff at dusk, soft purple sky, volumetric fog, octane render, --ar 16:9 --no text watermark"
    }
    `;
}

export function multimodalToImageTemplate(context: string): string {
  return `
    You are preparing a TEXT PROMPT *and* a list of reference IMAGES for a multimodal image-generation engine.

    1. Gather every string that appears to be an image URL or local path (extensions: .png .jpg .jpeg .gif .webp). Preserve their order. If the context strongly implies an image but no literal path is present, create a short descriptive placeholder such as "sketch_reference.png".

    ${COMMON_PROMPT_GUIDELINES}

    Additional guidance for editing / modification requests:
    • If the user wants to transform or edit existing images, include clear, concise directives that reference the relevant image by index or description. Examples:
        - "Replace the sky in image[0] with a starry night."
        - "Merge image[0] and image[1] with a double-exposure effect."
        - "In image[2], change the shirt colour to red and add a futuristic visor."
    • Layering, masking, cropping, recolouring, or style-transfer instructions are welcome when they help achieve the desired outcome.

    Context Chain:
    ${context}

    Return a JSON object with two fields: "prompt" (string) and "images" (string array).
    Example:
    {
      "prompt": "Cyberpunk cityscape re-imagined as an ancient watercolor, wide view, moonlit night, --ar 21:9 --no logos modern vehicles",
      "images": [
        "https://example.com/original_city.jpg",
        "https://example.com/color_palette.png"
      ]
    }
