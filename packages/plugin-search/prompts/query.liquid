Generate a query for a search engine based on the context chain. Your response should be a JSON object with a single "query" field containing the search phrase.

Do NOT include any metadata, context information, or explanation of how the response was generated.
Focus on the user's most recent intent found in the context.

Here is the context chain:
{{ context }}

Example:
{
  "query": "Latest results of the 2024 French Open final"
}
