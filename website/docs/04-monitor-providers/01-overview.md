# Monitoring in Maiar

Maiar's monitoring system provides a way to observe and track your agent's activities in real-time. Whether you need to debug complex behavior, visualize performance metrics, or integrate with external monitoring solutions, Maiar's monitor providers offer a flexible solution.

## The Monitor Provider System

At its core, a monitor provider in Maiar implements a simple interface that receives events from the runtime:

```typescript
interface MonitorProvider {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly name: string;
  readonly description: string;

  init?(): Promise<void>;
  publishEvent(event: {
    type: string;
    message: string;
    timestamp: number;
    metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  }): Promise<void>;
  checkHealth(): Promise<void>;
}
```

This interface allows Maiar to:

- Support multiple monitoring solutions simultaneously
- Handle provider failures gracefully
- Provide consistent event publishing across all monitors
- Easily extend with custom monitoring implementations

## Why Monitor Providers Matter

Monitoring is critical for understanding your agent's behavior, especially as they grow more complex. Consider these use cases:

1. **Debugging** - Track model inputs and outputs to identify issues
2. **Performance Metrics** - Measure response times and resource usage
3. **User Interactions** - Log conversations and user engagement
4. **Integration** - Connect your agent to existing monitoring infrastructure
5. **Visualization** - Create dashboards or real-time displays of agent activity

## Using Multiple Monitors

One of the strengths of Maiar's monitoring system is the ability to use multiple providers simultaneously:

```typescript
import { ConsoleMonitorProvider } from "@maiar-ai/monitor-console";
import { WebSocketMonitorProvider } from "@maiar-ai/monitor-websocket";
import { CustomMonitorProvider } from "./custom-monitor";

const runtime = createRuntime({
  // ... other configuration
  monitors: [
    new ConsoleMonitorProvider(),
    new WebSocketMonitorProvider({ port: 3001 }),
    new CustomMonitorProvider()
  ]
});
```

Each monitor will receive the same events, allowing you to view agent activity through multiple interfaces or systems.

## Best Practices

1. **Use specific event types** - Create a consistent taxonomy of event types (`model_request`, `user_message`, etc.)
2. **Include relevant metadata** - Add context to events with metadata like token counts, user IDs, or timing information
3. **Health checks** - Implement robust `checkHealth()` methods to ensure your monitoring is operational
4. **Error handling** - Design monitors to fail gracefully without affecting the main agent functionality
5. **Performance** - Be mindful of performance impacts, especially with network-based monitors
